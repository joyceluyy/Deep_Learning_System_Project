It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
Oh look at this guy.
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
Give me that wave!
Yeah, I'm free, why?
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
What?
Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
Let's not even analyze it.
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
Friday night.
Yep.
Come on up.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Oh, you dig?
Why?
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
What am I drinking, milk?
Hi.
Thank you.
With that?
What car?
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
Yeah, Queens.
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
What?
Oh, it was nothing.
Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
I know a little.
He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
Australia?
But not anymore.
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
We just met.
Ask George to go with you.
Why do you even need anybody?
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
Come on up.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
What if she's having an off night?
Hi.
A stupid what?
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Entertainment Tonight's on.
Bedroom.
What's it like out?
Can I take a sweater?
Scarf?
What's the matter? What's going on?
What is wrong?!
Get together?
Yeah.
What car?
Yeah who?
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
The blond with the blue sweatpants!
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
How am I going to live with myself?!
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
There should be more people like us.
You're telling me.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
Thank you very much.
Let me rephra-
Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
Well I think I get the gist of it.
What car?
It's not complicated.
Alright Elaine.
It was just a couple of blocks.
It's not that hard.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
$875?
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
Um, who do I make it out to?
So, what are you doing this weekend?
I didn't do it!
You are soo good lookin'.
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
Alright!
What?!
What did I do?
I-
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
No, never.
You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
I like the button fly.
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
Theres nothing to get.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
She sees something in him.
Why?
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
What's this?
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
Is he okay?
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
How you feeling?
(pointing) There's George!
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
That's what she told me!
That's what it costs!
I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
Well, she framed it and everything.
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
(reading note) Oh my god!
This is amazing, you can't believe this!
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
Should I?
ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
Yeah?
Come on up.
...Yeah.
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
Yeah.
HUGE pop-in guy!
Yeah.
Okay!
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
Let go!
Let go, Elaine!
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
How's it coming?
Seen any good movies lately?
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I know.
What's the difference?
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
You have to know, you must know.
Well, I'm not telling you.
Nope. I don't think so.
Not today, pal.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
I loaned the car to George.
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Huh?
Will you stop it already?!
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
*I* don't like you!
Why not?
Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
No, I like Mike.
Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
Oh yeah? What did he say?
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
Please, don't make me beg.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
Kramer!
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
He what?
A phony? He called me a phony?
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
He is?
A gun?!
My god, are you okay?
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Where's George now?
What are you talking about?
(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
Are you okay?
Crazy kids, huh?
Oh, hey Mike.
I'm coming down.
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
Yeah, he's a real phony.
Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
I didn't know.
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
You're right. My fault.
It was a so-so sorry.
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
What did you do to my car?!
I thought you said you were a good driver!
I think you said driver.
Hey Sid.
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
Hey Matthew.
How ya doing?
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
Oh no, nothing.
No, no, no, no.
No, of course not, of course not!
I didn't--
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
Mike thinks I'm a phony.
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
Open my vault?
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
Oy ga-vault.
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
I still don't have to go.
Why? I'll tell you why.
Like you didn't call me a phony?
Use it in a sentence.
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
Kramer, what are you doing here!?
You scared me!
That's enough!
Kramer! What are you doing?!
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
C'mon!
Move it! Move it! Get going!
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
No, come on!
It was sold out!
That's the point.
Just, look, just give the keys.
Don't ask me!
I'm telling you.
I'm serious!
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
So put 'em in a safe place.
Where?
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
I can't.
Who's there?
Elaine...
Take the keys.
O.K.!
Your spare set?
You want 'em back?
Did you bring the keys?
This could be an emergency!
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
They lost.
Kramer?
Hello, Newman.
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
Turn around, George.
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Where's Kramer?
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
Bad rap?
Me?
L.A.?
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Huh?
No, what'd you say?
Oh, you didn't see it.
I heard you say something, there.
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
She's drunk out of her mind.
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
What is the big deal?
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
Do you wanna fight?
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
What's that?
I heard something.
Well, this is great.
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
By Elaine Benes?
Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
All right, here!
What? What?
It was funny!
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
I did not!
Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
Good!
Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
Is that something you want to do?
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
What did you say?
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
Tonight.
I... don't... know...
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Yeah, I did that too.
Sure.
Wow!
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Nobody you know...
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...
Yes I did.
Wood is good.
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.
What, you rented "Home Alone"?
I thought you saw that already...
Oh, right... But you *hated* it!
What for?
All right.. Go ahead.
Yeah?
No. Come on up.
What's wrong?
You said "gloves"...
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
What?
Oh, the "triangle" guy.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
Artsy?
Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
All right we'll wait for you.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
All right (picks up his sports bag)
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
That's terrible...
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
No, I believe it's next week.
No I'm not...
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
I dunno...
Yeah, that's true...
Hey.
What are doing, you crying??
You crying from "Home Alone"??
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
You mean Florence Nightingale. **
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
Yeah, I think you would.
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
I will.
No, it isn't. I can find out.
There are ways.
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
Oh... *you*...
No.
"Hest"? That's not a name.
I know, I should've asked her.
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
No...
Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)
How am I gonna do that?
You asked a date to go to the operation?
Mulva? (waves off George with his hand)
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
What are you eating?
No...
Where'd you get those?
No.
I don't want one.
I don't want any!
No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
Into the patient, *literally*!
Yes, the hole!
No!
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
Yes!
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Yeah.
Come on up.
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
How could you not believe me?!?
That's true.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
Prognosis *negative*!?
We gotta confess.
Yes!
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
I'm telling and you can't stop me!
Oh yeah, that's the spot...
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
Mulva?
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
Yeah.
Oh, good idea...
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
O.K. (closes the apartment door)
Oh, okay.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
Bye.
No, I haven't heard anything.
Really...
Yeah, I'm sure...
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
Why?
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
Oh, that's *fantastic*!
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
That's nice.
What do you mean?
I don't think so...
I believe we're not...
Well, I'll think about it...
Really...
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Do you have it with you?
Ah, Le'me see. (hands Jerry the playbill)
Yeah, I-I know...
Yes I do.
It-it rhymes with a female body part.
Mulva...
Aub, ah, Gipple?
Loleola?
Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
Is that bothering you?
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
He'll like you more...
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
So, where am I dropping you?
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
So, is tonight "the night"?
Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!
Boy, do you smell something?
What is it?
What?
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
But the whole car smells.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
What about skunk?
Horse manure?
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
It means he's lying.
Why? Is that what he told you?
No. Never.
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
Anything's *possible*...
What's the matter with you?
Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...
I know the list...
What smell?
Whatd'ya mean I stink?
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
Yeah.
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
No, no. It's the valet guy.
Oh... No, that's ridiculous.
Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
Stinks!
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
That's from the car!
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
You've gotta smell the car
C'mon! One whiff!
Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
Let's do it.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
It still smells!
I don't know!
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
Susan!
What is going on?
That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
'90.
That's strange...
23 000.
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
You don't like the Drake?
How could you not like the Drake?
The Drake is good!
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
Easy?
Do you like the Drake?
It's Isosceles
The chip-in!
Yeah!
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
What about your father's car?
Are you serious?
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
Good to meet you!
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
Yes, they do!
Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
Hey, what's going on over here?
(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?
Is she OK?
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
I don't know...
I love the Drake!
Let's get out of here.
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Not if they don't know you...
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
The Drake is great!
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
Yes?
Come on up.
St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?
Wow, what happened?
What?
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
So where're we eatin'?
When did this happen?
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
They know how to make 'em...
Well... we should...
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
I know it is!
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.
I don't know about defraying.
We're not gettin' that TV.
You are.
Because that's your thing!
Yeah, that's your thing.
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Yeah.
Charity?!? That's apalling.
Your father got arrested? For what?
Ho-ly!
So what are you gonna do?
What?
What's the matter?
What's over?
She dumped you?
Drop dead?
She's pretty rough!
240 bucks?
Used?
That's their policy.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
My grandmother's in the hospital.
This is real believable.
It stinks.
Say something funny.
Ah..........
We're acting. (they stop laughing)
No.
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
(to George) Again with the sweat pants?
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
(to Kramer) Who is it?
NBC!?! Give me the phone!
Get off the phone!
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
Where?
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
Would you stop?
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
Whatever it is.
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.
Everything all right?
No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
Alright, want to start?
O.K.
What look?
I gave a look?
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
Very good
(to George) It was a wonderful reading.
Yeah, I liked him.
(to Kramer) What are you doing here?
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Yes.
She's an eskimo, actually.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
No, he didn't show up.
No. No you're not.
I don't know.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
What's going on here. How is that possible?
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
What did he say?
Alright. So?
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
Hey. What happened to you yesterday?
Mugged?
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
Yeah?
Come on up.
What is it?
You didn't go?
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
He's a little backed up.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
This is what you gonna wear?
You're not gonna get the job.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
They're having sex in the hotel room.
Yes.
Uh, Huh, yeah.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
With her hands.
Also with her hands.
Everything?
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
Shaft.
She likes talking during sex.
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
What?
All right. Elaine.
Well--
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
I think you got it.
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
Danish. Is it from Denmark?
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Nothing.
No.
Are we going out?
Do you want me to break up with you?
I don't even know what you're talking about.
All right. We're broken up.
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
Why?
You mentioned the raisins.
Did he take 'em?
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
Hey.
Any luck?
What about bran?
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Oh, it's not that bad!
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
We need you there!
Try Elaine.
Just relax, you'll be fine.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
It means "Death to tyrants".
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
Well, well, well.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
A wallet? Let me see that.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
How do you like that?
Hey George.
Yeah.
I like sneakers.
Nah, you're crazy anyway.
All right.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
Yeah.
Hello, Charles.
Why don't you start in the bedroom?
Hey. The butler's here.
I'm not sending him to your house.
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
But I don't want to.
Yeah?
Come on up.
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
What's all this about?
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
Because he's my butler!
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)
(to the phone) Hello?
Oh, hi Rita.
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?
Russell's disappeared?
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
No one knows.
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
What a family!
What?
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
Oh, that's gold, baby.
I was saying 'baby' way before George!
Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
Yeah.
Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
Yeah.
Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
Hey, Ronnie.
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
I don't...I dunno.
Oh, is this a bit?
(turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
Good, good.
Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
Yeah.
O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
Hey! What is wrong with you?!
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
Oh, I can take it.
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
Really? Her mother.
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
Yeah, well, it's honest.
Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, that'd be something.
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
Why can't I?
You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
There's no precedent, baby!
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
Boo!
Hiss!
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
You kept makin' all the stops?
She got the promotion?
Why?
Too bad.
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Yeah, well, it won't be long.
Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
George - could I have a word?
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
Didn't they just have a baby?
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
No.
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
She's makin' the three o'clock train.
I bought him some kishka.
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
No thanks.
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
No lines.
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
Jane's topless. (They all look)
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
Oh, in a minute, Carol.
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
No thanks.
So very gorgeous.
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
It's a must lie situation.
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
Okay. (He leaves)
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
She's got greeting problems.
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
You got lobster for everybody?
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
No.
Yeah.
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
Well what'd you mean?
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
I've never been called breathtaking either.
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
How are you gonna do that?
You might have.
You won't.
Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
Wait'll you get to know him.
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
So what?
But...
Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
So you feel you were short changed.
Well, so what's the difference?
Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
Women aren't like us.
No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
Isn't it common knowledge?
Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
Like a frightened turtle!
No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
(To George) Easy big fella.
You told her?
You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
Yeah.
Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
They got some sort of program.
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
You got a raise?
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Oh, when did that happen?
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
Oh, the beach.
What is it that isn't working?
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
What's happening?
Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
What're you gonna talk about?
Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
(shocked) Broke even.
So it's all over?
And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Played cards last night.
Broke even.
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
What for?
(shocked) What the hell was that?
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
Bad.
So you just did the opposite of everything?
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
Elaine ... look! A twenty!
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
Yes?
Uh huh?
Oh, that's okay.
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
Sure. See, things always even out for me.
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
The New York Yankees?!
Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
I can't believe it.
Ya?
(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
That's a great place!
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Hi Elaine.
How're things going?
Why? Why are they doing that?
The jewel thief?
What else?
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
Is that the end of it?
Alright.
He knows what he's doing.
Opposite.
Why'd you have to eat so many?
Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
Don't say that.
Ah ... let's call it even.
(cuts in) A nude model.
You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
Yeah!
What?
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
Soo...
No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
It's just...
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Thanks.
Ah! boy.
Yeah! So
Yeah! It's a doodle.
Oh!.It's an affectionate caricature.
It's just a drawing.
the usual
Good for you
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
Don't ask.
No ,it's George ( Elaine laughs heartily)
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
What's in?
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
Nah, I don't wanna
I don't want it..
I DON'T WANT IT ....
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
..What is this?
Yeah! I think I got flea bites.
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
No.
How could I have fleas?
What did you do about them?
Nothing...
Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
I don't understand this..
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
Okay..
I have fleas.
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
Come on,c'mon
c'mon ,c'mon....
c'mon, c'mon....
Yes!!!
Yes!!!
I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
I dunno...
That'd be the fleas.
Hey!!!
Yeah! it's all taken care of.
Oh! Hey!
Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
You see?
I told you to take it.
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
How do you feel?
Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
Can you get me a soda?
I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..
I forgot my toothbrush.
Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
She's seen you in this thing.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
Ahh! She threw me out.
I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
I hear you're going out with David Putty.
Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
All right.
Hi.
Yeah, so.
What move?
Wait a second. *My* move?
David Putty used *my* move?
Are you sure?
I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
What?
No! He stole my move!
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
Can I just get it opened first?
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
You feel better?
Nancy Klopper?
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
Is it padded?
Good. How tall is she?
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
What is it?
When did you do this?
Oh... Why Fusilli?
Well, thank you very much.
Assman?
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
Yeah. Proctologist.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
Hey, David.
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
Swirl.
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
Fine.
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
Yeah?
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
Except that it's not Putty.
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
Hey, Elaine.
Is it something I said?
Really?
What is it?
Huh.
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
Yeah. Kramer made it.
Hey, Assman!
Hi.
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?
I don't know. Why?
What do you mean?
Really, stopping short. That's a good move.
Hey.
Oh, my god!
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
He had to use cork-screw pasta.
Assman!
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
You're marchin' in.
Hey. Elaine's quitting.
How 'bout the march out?
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
Why?
What for?
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
Yes, I know. I've flown before.
No.
I don't care.
Who?
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
Oh, it doesn't matter now.
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
(To Katie) What is the complication?
Yes?
What?
I didn't care.
He can't just throw me off the plane!
But I'm not a disturbance!
But someone is waiting for me!
I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
Which one do you think I want?
Then we'll make it the eight.
Hotel?
No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
George.
I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
Carl, I think.
Yeah, he was nice.
Defent.
You need an exterminator?
Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
George, George!
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
I am a little freaked out!
All right, but you have to go now.
(Wakes up) Where are we?
Is this even a road?
What? Why didn't you wake me up?
No, road is a major detail!
(Pointing ahead) Look out!
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
Bridget!
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
What are you telling him for?
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
John Houseman?
Hi, Alec.
Yeah.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
Alright, thanks again.
Really, thank you.
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
They're the worst.
Well, what is with you?
Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
Toilet paper?
What are you talking about?
Toilet paper's changed.
It's softer.
More sheets per roll
Comes in a wide variety of colors.
What?
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
What about you, George?
Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
Sure, fine with me.
"I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
Big matzoh ball.
Those damn 'I love you' returns.
Oh, you don't know.
Unless you're married.
No, people hate that.
Ideally.
No question about it.
At the zoo?
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
It's a monkey, Kramer!
Well, I still think it's wrong.
I'm not taking anyone's side.
No.
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
Ah, you're out of your mind.
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
Gotta support the team.
Hm.
Hm.
Hm.
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
Hey.
Well?
Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
What?
Are you gonna say it again?
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
He's gonna talk into her other ear.
Yeah, I saw him.
Well, not exactly.
I don't know if he's mad.
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
Look, what do you want me to do?
No. No, I can't!
Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
No.
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
Oh, you already gave them away?
No, we don't care, we just want to go.
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
Of course.
yeah,
The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
She might be. She's the star of the show.
Yeah, maybe.
That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
Yeah.
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
You know who speaks Korean?
George's father.
He used to go there a lot on business.
He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
George, does your father speak Korean?
Oh, hi Gennice.
This is George, this is Kramer.
Playing today?
They really stick to that understudy rule.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
Come on George, just loosen up.
Come on George.
(to George) Keep going.
Well we
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
Come back another time.
I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
Stop your crying will ya?
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
What?
What happened?
Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
Where?
(pushing her) How did you get that?
You met J. Peterman?
What is he like?
(walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.
Well, break a leg tonight.
Listen buddy,
What is it?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
Good luck.
What bet?
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
Huh.
No. nothing.
What's with you?
Wow.That's hot.
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
I got a date with Nikki.
She's also quite bold.
Hey, Elaine.
This is Nikki.
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
Why don't you see what you can do?
We'll see.
Yeah. Why?
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
Sure. If there cheap Why not.
Told you.
All right. Enjoy"Blame it on the Rain"
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
What the hell is all this?
Why can't you do this on your table?
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
So what happened after the movie?
To the door?
That's a date.
But I never walk you home.
No, no.
So how did you leave it with him?
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
Crazy like a man.
I was got to be 55.
A lot faster than that!
Okay dokey
Absolutely. Nikki!
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
All right Nik. That's it.
You got your shirt in my oven!?!
For both of us.
What's wrong with your oven?
Yeah.
Come on up.
I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
No. I never had a job.
Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
What kind of pie are you cooking?
I did.
Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
What's that?
Oh.
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
He pulled an LBJ on you.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
Hey.
Can I have my keys...
(catching keys) ...back, please?
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
Hi Sue Ellen.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
Think she wants those clubs.
Well, that's your ceiling.
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Do you hear this clunking?
Okay.
Bye.
What's going on here?
Oh God!
(angry) Oh, you idiots!
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
No, thank you.
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
No, I hadn't noticed.
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
Try to.
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
Okay, so how does it go?
'... downtown.'
'...downtown.'
Seven-eleven?
No, that's midtown.
'...down town.'
'...downtown.'
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
How can you lose?
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Oh, you know what?
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
I forgot.
I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
Hey, Tony.
Sure.
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
I really wanna...
How much money is this gonna cost me?
The washer fluid is fine.
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
Well, just get it down.
Okay. Thank you, very much.
He's bringing it.
Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
He's a very special maniac.
I don't know.
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
Had I been taking...?
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
Not that I would think of doing such things.
Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
They're looking.
Y'hello.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
Are there golf clubs in the back?
(indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
Yeah.
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
Oh my God!
What is that smell?
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
Hello.
Tony, where are you?
Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
Tony.
(exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
(answering phone) Y'hello.
Why, what's up?
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
Last check-in, they were still on him.
No, they won't call the police.
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
Not a Federal record.
What's going on?
Kramer, I want my car.
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
How's the gas situation?
Duck, Kramer! Duck!
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
(hearing the noises) What's happening!
(disappointment) Dammit!
Hairdo?
You look like Brenda Starr.
It's better than Dondi.
(Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
Hi, Beth!
Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?
Really?
Kramer?
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
Ehh, I dunno..
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
(Out of it) Huh?
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
What'd you say?
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
Slim-fit?
You're walkin' like Frankenstein!
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
Sure, dinner would be fine.
What's wrong?
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
(Still pulling) Squinch em!
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
So how did this all happen?
(stunned) Is that right?
Maybe, maybe
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
Never mind
You're a Genius!
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
According to them
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
Talk to Beth?
You're not undoing anything.
Oh no you're not!
(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
What are you talking about?
Hey, are you still wearing those things.
See you later
Hello
(excited) Oh, Hi Beth
(under his breath) George.
Um. I'll call you back ok?
Trouble
George
ya
What are we gonna do?
Ya i could try and do that.
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
No, no. I'll take the subway.
Na, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.
It's really not necessary.
I don't feel so good.
Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
I'm nauseous.
A little
It's not bad.
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
What's coming?
Ahhh...The Day..
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
Why not?
All right take it easy, just take it easy.
A letter.
That's it?
You can't go to China What about your job?
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
Aagh! You come back for your clothes
So forget about your clothes.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
And what, hope for a crash?
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
Euhh...Elaine....
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
Does she hate cigarettes?
But you don't smoke.
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
See you ... me and Kramer...
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
They're not making higher roofs.
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
.....Stupid , stupid.
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
oh! thank you.
Well I...
What?
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
No. I know what I want.
Yeah.,
Yeah!!!
Uh! Really .That's nice.
I think I'm in love.
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
I just met her, she's incredible.
You can go with Kramer
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Yeah.
Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
Hey.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
What's with you?
Something on your mind?
Looks like there is?
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
You don't like her?
What's wrong with her?
Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
That's how it's gonna be.
Will you marry me?
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
George, big news; I'm getting married!!
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
Hey look , Champagne..
To our future wives....yeah...
Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
(weakly) I dunno
(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
Thanks , thanks
Yeah , yeah .
I think I may have made a big mistake.
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
Yeah! Too bad.
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
They just took Susan to the Hospital
So she was just lying there.
Dead?
Yeah! me too
How did it happen?
So I guess , you're not getting married?
But....
Well , now I'm engaged..
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
WE HAD A PACT!!!
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
After two dates!
Seven.
Hey.
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
What for?
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
I don't mind the Mayans.
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
Hello? Who's this?
Seven?
Good meeting?
You can do that.
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
So, George...
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.
I like the way you think.
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
Some of us.
Hola.
What is all this?
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Hi Valerie.
You're not Valerie.
But, I never...
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
What? No.
Yikes!
How could they not fire you?
Aw, come on there now.
Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
Everything.
Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
That's the spirit. You suck!
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
Okay.
Uh, good.
(nervous) What?
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
Valerie's not coming over, is she?
No...
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
Oh my God, George!
Kramer, look, it's George.
(neutral) Fine.
(neutral) No problem.
What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
(to himself) Still a rip-off.
Hello?
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
Hold on a second.
Hello?
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
Hello?
Well...
Hang on.
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
Hang on.
She wants to be back on yours.
Hang on.
Fine, if I'm off yours.
Sorry. Hang on.
Fine, if I'm off yours.
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
(hurried) Great, bye.
She said she'll do it.
Hang on.
Hello?
She never sees the big picture.
Hello, Newman!
No.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Aww!
Hello?
It's Jerry. Who's this?
Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Hello?
Let's go.
For how long?
Come on.
I'm going to be this guy's friend.
New clothes?
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
You look like a tourist.
When you hear like a soft russeling.
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
So who's the new you?
Oh hi Alex.
No.
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
Hmm. That looks new.
(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
(uncomfortably) Nothing.
I did something stupid.
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
Well women do it.
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
Um hum.
Hey!
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Really?
So you're pretending to be a tourist?
How do you explain your apartment?
you moved into a hotel?
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
What is it she think you can't do?
How did you do those things?
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
Oh that's an old wives tale.
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
Why do I have to go on the tour?
Hey, how's business?
You also shouldn't use a donut.
Can we just go?
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
What's that?
Oh. Yeah.
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
Maybe I should ask her out?
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
They're musicians. That's not a joke.
They did it for three years. What's another few months.
Like what?
I've always wanted to do that...
You mean golf?
Like this? (imitates the walk)
That's so strange.
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
Reer.
Boy, your really packing it all in.
Like what?
Stomach ache?
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
Where are you sitting?
What academy?
Hi!
Thanks, it's a breakaway.
Absolutely.
Ok...
Thanks, Lyle...
So, you and Lyle are roommates?
Gay?
Is he gay?
Are you sure?
(to himself) This is a new one.
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
What do you think it could've been just some dude?
I reckon.
Dude!
It's 1030 in the morning?
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
You didn't give that thing back?
That's because you didn't win.
You haven't even seen it.
Hi!
No rush.
(to himself) I have absolutely no idea.
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
It's Kramer.
George says hi.
Why don't you just come over?
He's looking on to fridgerator.
I can't do this.
He's not doing anything. Goodbye!
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
Oh, hello.
All right, all right.
I said no! (hangs up the phone.)
Just me? No dudes or fellas?
I can start right away.
But not here. (They leave.)
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
Eh, what?
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
Sure.
The one with the...(mumbles.)
Ok, ok...
No, I'll crab it.
What, did you lose your remote?
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
Not.
No, because that's...
Here.
I'm trying.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
She seems very nice.
I'm in show business.
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
Did you tell Peterman about this?
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
You got the tickets?
I like it.
What?
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
35, and George, on the invitations...
I like your nails, that is a great color.
This old thing?
Ok, let's towel it up.
But we're in towels.
all right. One second.
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
...what?
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
What happened to you?
Yikes.
What happened to you?
Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
Back on the rack.
I think we're still a man short.
Yeah...
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
Keep your shirt on. I got it.
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
How was it?
Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
Heh.
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
What is that music?
Oh, no.
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
All right, I'm worming.
They're not letting me in.
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
One more lane to go.
Maroon Golf.
Could you move your car back a little?
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
Can you believe her?
Where are you going?
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
That's not what I do.
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
Walk away?
Isn't there a deductible?
I don't know.
From what?
We're not leaving the car!
Absolutely not. He sped up.
I'm ready to talk.
What's that?
Ok!
What's that on your forehead?
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
Elaine?!
So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
Elaine, he doesn't need-
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
I don't know.
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
Hey, there's the soda guy.
What seems to be the problem, officer?
At me?
Oh. It's back.
What if it gets in the side?
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
Oh. It's in your eye now.
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
You were watchin'? Where?
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
Not Pennypacker!
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
Oh, hello...
Mr. Vandelay, of course.
Pennypacker.
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
The Saab factory?
My car!
I love a parade!
Well, what about my car?
Hey, there's Elaine.
Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
Well, at least he didn't-
Somebody remember where we parked.
I know what you mean.
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
To see a movie.
Not this movie.
Did you shower today?
That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
What is that?
Ey, ey!
Nothing.
Have a good time.
You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
Faux pas.
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
It's pompous.
Hey - hey - hey!
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
Right.
Yeah!
Today, like right now.
"Jerry"!
He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
"Jerry"!
Sure!
Forget the sports jacket.
You're not a writer.
Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
Don't blow this.
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
He might not want nothing.
He might want a show about anything and everything.
All right.
What?
Good, good. You remember George.
Don't spell.
Shut up, George.
Oy.
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
He's a little off the wall.
Definitely.
Yeah!
Hi. Elaine, it's me.
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
Did you hear what I said?
Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
Hey - how was the beach?
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
Yeah, only for a while.
No, I'll be back.
And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
Anywhere.
I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
Russia, it's so bleak.
It's still bleak.
You can be bleak in spring.
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
Hello, Newman. What gives?
Yeah, that's right.
Really.
That's a shame.
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Yeah.
All set. We'll just grab the bags.
Just keeps on getting better and better.
Not bad.
You're complaining about a private jet?
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
You're not writing any letters!
Still got water in your ear?
Kramer, what the hell did you do?
Kramer!
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Yeah.
What? What is it?
What?
Why?
Great - I won.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
Alright.
We're straightening out!
Where are we?
Okay.
We'll see you later.
I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
Alright, I'll feel him out.
Another one?
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
Under arrest? What for?
Oh, yeah.
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
I forgot about the video.
Plane's ready.
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Good morning.
No.
This one?
Do I have to?
Yeah.
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Gimme that rye.
I want that rye lady.
Shut up, you old bag!
The virgin!
Who the hell is that?
That's right, the Bubble Boy.
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
Who?
Medium crab bisque.
Just forget it. Let it go.
How did they find Babu?
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
It's not that bright orange one is it?
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
What?
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
Sure.
I think that would be a very nice gesture.
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
You think?
Yeah, maybe we have.
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
