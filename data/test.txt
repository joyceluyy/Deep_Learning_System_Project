Oh, yes you will.
Yeah, maybe you won't.
Are my nostrils getting bigger?
Oh, so there's still hope.
Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
Went out with George, you?
How was it? What'd you talk about?
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
George too.
I've never fixed anybody up.
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
Well you implied it.
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
He's George!
So what?
I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
I went out with you.
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
Naturally.
Everything.
Why?
She's good looking.
Very good looking.
Really very good looking.
Yes, I would take her out.
What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
I'm telling you, she's good looking.
Good body, nice body.
Nice.
Pretty nice.
Really very nice and good.
Good personality. Funny. Bright.
How could she be smarter than you?
You know, long dark hair.
Flowing?
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
Just clarifying.
Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
I think you'll get it out.
She's got a fine cheek.
A pinkish hue?
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
I think it's tamber.
I didn't notice the voice.
So, Saturday night.
She could have mentioned the conversation.
Hey.
Oh, the guy from Jersey?
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
You can tell me, I'll vault it.
I'm locking the vault. What?
Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
At your apartment?
She didn't stay over?
So, what did she have to say?
He said they had a good time.
Oh, good.
Nope. You?
You sure?
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay then.
Goodnight.
Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
I'm gonna call her.
No, I'm calling her.
No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
I'll just call her when you leave!
It is so my business!
Yeah, but--
But Kramer--
Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
Oh, hi. Soda?
So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Get your finger out of my face.
I don't care.
How did you know they were defective?!
Acting.
Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
So what are these?
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
You chuck.
Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
Believe me I didn't see anything.
No, did you?
Why?
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
All right
All right
You know who that is? That's
Yeah, that's him.
Positive.
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
Hey, should we say something to him?
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
So?
I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
Really?
What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
Thank you.
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
Oh. that would be great.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
I can't ... I can't
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
For what dinner?
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
... this is all .. very confusing.
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
Hellooo Newman.
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
Again
Back and to the left Back and to the left
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
But that is not what they would have you believe.
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
No. What happened to you?
I'm Vandelay Industries?
And what is that?
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
And what do I say about you?
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
Yeah.
All right we're coming down.
Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
Well that was really fun, thanks.
Well, ...
No, I haven't.
Sure, that would be great.
I mean, ... if you want to.
Yeah, Friday's okay.
Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
Elaine?
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
For a date?
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
.... (silence)
So then we went to dinner.
We split it.
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
Yeah
Come on up.
Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.
(smiling) Yeah
Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
Hi Elaine.
What date? It's a GUY.
Already?
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
Oh, ya' going?
Ah, really.
Friday?
He's going' out with you on Friday?
He's supposed to see ME on Friday.
We made plans.
No, don't cancel it.
Well, frankly it is.
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
Any Hennigans around here?
Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
No. No. I don't mind at all.
Sure, we can do something next week.
No, its no problem at all.
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
Hey what are you doing Friday night?
Friday night? Nothin', ... now.
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
All right, I'll go
And you want to be my latex salesman.
(to baby) Hello. How are you/
Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
He's joking.
I was saying the same thing.
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
Jerry, You want to pick her up?
I better not.
I don't know him. I know who he is.
I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
So, did you two, uh,  have uh,
You know
No!
Did he kiss you good night?
What do you mean you don't know?
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
So, you like him.
Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
That was Keith.
He wants me to help him move.
You know, furniture.
I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
I said yes.
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
hey Kramer do me a favour .
Don't mention it to anybody.
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
Really?
I don't know  six three.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
DeSoto? What did he do?
Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
I know isn't that something?
I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!
Is there a box spring?
Is there a box spring?
Is that a sectional?
Is that a thick marble?
STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
I told you!
But why? Why McDowell?
Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
Well Biff/ What's next?
George.
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
So you have no car?
So what good are you?
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
Yeah, right.
He's definitely in Chicago.
How would we do it?
Maybe he knows O'Brien?
What if we get caught?
Who's gonna be O'Brien?
Who am I?
Just me?
Okay.
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
Dylan Murphy.
What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
You could be Colin.
I'm Dylan Murphy.
Come on,
Colin?
What for?
She happy for you?
No. Why?
He can't hear us.
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
What?
We're going to the Knick game!
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Maybe it's a shortcut.
(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
I'm Seinfeld!
We're doing sixty miles an hour!
Who are you, Mannix?
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
Newsletter?
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
Never seen a picture of him?
Not even on the book jacket?
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
He tends to exaggerate.
Well you might as well look it over.
You're not going to open with that, are you?
Nice looking Lugar.
What's taking him so long out there?
She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
Let's just make a run for it.
How'd that happen?
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
I don't know.
Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
We were right on the border.
Get in the car! Get in the car!
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
Yeah, it's funny!
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.
(Thinks) What does she say...?
I don't know.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
Hey.
Who?
Did you talk to her?
So what happened?
Yeah, I know about the three dates.
What do you mean, you snubbed her?
Yeah, I know.
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
Well, Gail Cunningham.
Why?
Are you sure?
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
Ah, the power lunch crowd.
Would you care to join us?
See ya.
That bothered you?
It did?
I thought your mother's paying for it.
You what?
You kissed her?
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
And what did she do?
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
So what?
Are you alright?
Oh, Where did you eat?
Ah. I know the chef there.
Oh, you have a daughter?
What?
What?
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
Yeah.
Another ending?
Maybe we should go.
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
Hi.
Oh, I'm Jerry.
We're here discussing our script with your father.
Uh huh.
What were you doing?
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
That's why I poked.
What?
She did?
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
She is?
Hello? Oh, hi Stu.
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
No.
Ya.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
Beautiful.
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
I'll get you another one just like it!
Hey! Whattaya know!
Fancy meeting you here!
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
Really good.
Very tasty.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
It's funny!
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
If you can.
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
Unbelievable! She's not there.
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
Living or all time?
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
[indignantly] What's the matter with you?
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
Y'know I hear that all the time.
That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?
You told me that already like two months ago.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Yeah, I washed it.
So *wash* *it*.
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
[quizzically] Live together?
Know *what*?
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
I mean I have many gay friends...
It was a *joke*...
No steam!
Today's not my birthday.
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
Hey, where you going?
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
What are you talkin' about?
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Well, maybe she was disconnected.
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".
What do you got there?
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
Here we go...
It's not true!
So are you...
Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?
Ma!
Ma, it's not true!
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
What?
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
What!?
I know! What are you doin' here?!?
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
Tell her what?
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Yeah, how about a mute?
Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
A deep, yawning chasm...
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Hey! How you doin'?
What're you gonna do down there?
That's what I do with him [points at George]
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
Nah, it's not for me.
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
Thank you.
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
*We*? No.
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
What're you talkin' about?
What?
Where do you *get* this?
Hello, *Newman*...
What records?
Why *is* that?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
Mr. Fields?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
No, no, the--
The woman, she--
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
What's all this stuff?
You're throwin' this out??
You don't want any of this?
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
Whattya mean?
He fired you?!?
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
So quit!
What happened?
Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
Well you said they could come and take the records.
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!
Well turn the light on...
That's the garbage disposal!
Yes, but--
[Into intercom] Yes?
Alright, c'mon up.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
Well, after he bit my friend--
I, I'm sorry.
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
There you are. Did you find him?
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
Alright.
Tremendous girl.
Yeah. I really like her.
What? Don't say that!
How do you know?
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
Yes, they do!
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
Well, I do.
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
You're sure?
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
Well, I take it very seriously.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
You? How do you know?
Real busy now down at the office?
You put her on a pedestal.
He puts 'em on a dental chair.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
You fell on her?
You what?
You touched 'em?!
Wow.
Excuse me?!
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
So have I.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Hey. George off to Detroit?
There's Sidra.
Where?
Talkin' to Sidra?
I don't think that's Salman.
If that's Rushdie, they're real.
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
Oh, how can you be so sure?
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
I'm gonna find out tonight.
Hey, would you mind switching seats?
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
How ya doin'?
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
Really?
How do you like that.
Aw, you know people.
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
Whatever you want me to tell them.
No.
Oh, there's no emergency...
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
Right, you were leaving.
That was an accident!
It's not good.
Well at breakfast everybody reads.
You read during lunch?
Oh, well.
Ya, what's there to talk about.
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
At least you'll be talking.
Hey, Al.
Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
Ya.
Me?
Ya, see ya.
(points to George) Ya.
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
Oh, stop it.
So you're not gonna come?
Hey! Hey Mick.
Nothing, what's doing with you?
George this is Mickey.
How's work going you guys?
How do you stop a kid from growing?
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
Who couldn't.
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
Hey Phil how you doing?
I got my health.
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?
Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Alright.
What?
So what are you gonna do?
Why?
Ya, I could see that.
No, me either.
None.
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
Towards what end?
Hey Mick.
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
So what does he care if you put lifts in?
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
So?
Come on. How was your date?
Ya how was it?
Really.
Why what happened?
Just put it.
(confused) He what?
He took what out?
He took It, Out?
He couldn't.
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
You mean he just
Are you sure?
There was no mistaking it?
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
It.
Out.
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
It.
Out.
Alright I'm going.
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
Yes I do.
I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
Oh hey Phil.
Well, y..you showed her who you are.
Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
Ya take it easy.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
This guy's belching out vitamins..
(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Good morning.
Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
No, no, 12-8!
I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
Oh, wow.
Oh, come on!
It's silly!
Get outta here!
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
Pardon?
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
Adoring? What about handsome?
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
I, uh...well...
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
No, just Meryl.
Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
See?
Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
Alright. (Elaine enters.)
The fly-boy.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
Hmm, So?
Really.
Ohhh, moisture?
That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
Yeah, so?
Here we go.
No, never.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
Hello.
What are you doing here?
Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
Uncle Leo?!
Hello.
Uh...I got married.
Well, it was sudden.
No, no, it was a small ceremony.
Yes, yes, you have.
You did, you did.
I'm a good printer.
Uncle Leo, wait!
Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
Listen, Ma...
Mom, I'm not married.
I'm not married!
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
That?
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
I Love you.
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Alright.
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
Where you goin'?
I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
I'm goin' home.
I want to!
Give me the clothes.
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
Do you want box or hanger?
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
Yes, that's right.
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
It's alright, I want you to have it.
We'll always have...pancakes.
You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
Not for another three days.
She lives with her parents.
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
The baldies
That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
Hey Alec
What happened?
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
Ya, it's much better isn't it?
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
What?
Yea?
What about little Joey?
Ah, I think he's probably better off.
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
Where'd you get plans?
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
So what plans do you have?
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Really? Since when?
Why?
No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
Ya?
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
He's nice, bit of a close talker.
You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
No I haven't.
I'm swamped.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
Ok.
I don't know.
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
(dialing) He got em out of the house.
Call Rachel.
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.
Oh sure like Monet.
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
Bye
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
N-na I'm paying for the trip.
He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
Ah come on.
No I haven't seen it yet.
I'm going
Ok
What are you talking about?
Look I don't know.
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
That's right.
Absolutely
These the people you currently live with?
Uh huh
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
What is that anyway?
I-I'll tell 'em
Name it.
So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
In two days.
I know.
Right, Thursday three o'clock.
Oh Hi.
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
What other time?
Where you goin'?
You don't have a car.
Come on stop.
(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
Ok. Uh
Ok, see you later.
What show?
When did you get tickets to see that?
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
Oh.
Oh
(answering phone) Hello?
Yea.
Oh hi Jack.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it.
Ya he's right here.
What did I do?
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
Hey.
Oh, really good, really good.
Like that (snaps his fingers)
Ya that was some list.
(confused) The black and white.
Oh yea, I didn't even realize.
Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
It is a tad askew.
I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
You're right he's insane.
So what are you going to do?
Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
How could I what?
What? No.
(turns) Newman.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
(answering the phone) Hello.
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
Tomorrow afternoon?
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
You want the tickets?
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
You know I'm paying for these tickets.
Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
Take care
Buh bye.
I think she meant me, but.
Ok.
Bye.
You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
Why what did I do?
Rachel!
Rachel!
So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
Whew
No I hadn't noticed.
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
Yes I was.
Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
Yes, well that was nothing.
You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
Oh. Your ballet tickets.
No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
A beard?
Yes.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.
Well what about me?
It sounds like an excellent idea.
You can't go wrong with pouty.
Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
And did they suspect anything?
And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
You said that already.
Yeah.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
Yeah, but?
So?
Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
Are you that desperate?
So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
What are you looking for?
Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
What about a plastic bag?
What is the difference?
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
What did you say to her?
I don't know.
As you see it?
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
You know, you're little hair hat there.
Don't you think she could tell?
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
Hi Sarge.
What's that?
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
Really.
No.
I admit it. I don't watch it.
The poly?
Yes. Melrose Place.
Well I do.
Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
Did you shake it up?
You gotta shake it up.
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
How so?
She's bald?
Women go bald?
Hey.
Good to have you back.
She's as good as anybody else.
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
What?
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
Jerry Seinfeld.
129 West 81st street.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
He went back? What do you mean he went back?
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
I would think.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
Yeah? Would you do it?
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
No, we have time.
Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Like toothpaste?
There's a squeeze ketchup.
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
I really don't see the difference.
It's subtle.
(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
Bye.
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
Speak of the devil.
What for?
Why?
(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
Hello, uncle Leo!
Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
Hi Nana.
Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
Will you stop it.
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
I'm just not getting any hot water.
Thanks, Julio.
Huh?
What's going on here?
(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?
What for?
(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
I told you, forget it.
You're robbing me.
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
Yeah?
Come on up.
No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
(muffled) Hi Wendy.
(muffled) Would you like something to drink?
(muffled) There you go.
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
So, how's everything going?
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
C'mon, that's not fair!
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
...You can't put that picture up.
Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
(not really) Yeah.
Oh, sure, yeah.
Oh, no!
You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
What is so funny?
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
(not as eager) Hi Joan.
Pretty good.
Okay, great.
Oh, I'm delighted.
You too.
Hi, Louise.
Ah, well. Thank you very much!
(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
Family?
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
You should have her work on it for you.
Hi Mary.
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
Hi Louise...
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
Hello.
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
Okay, I will.
(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
Hey, Kramer, look at this.
Look at my picture!
I've been defaced!
Hi Jack.
Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
(defensive) No no, that's not true!
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
Buddy?
So you were with him that day at the track?
Leo?
Is that so?
Well, that's very interesting.
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
(with a triumphant point) You're busted!
Hey, Steve. How you doing?
Hey, Jeff. What's happening?
Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...
Hey. Could I use your shower?
(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.
(impressed) Who's that?
Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
Yeah.
Can I just go up?
How 'bout those Knicks?
Yeah.
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
We'll still make the movie.
Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
Alright, he just left. We can go.
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
Yeah, and?
What d'you mean, breasts?
So what? A lot of older men have that.
But, your father's not bald.
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
What? Nothing.
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
No.
Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
Yes, we do.
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
I'd like to be.
What?
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
Oh.
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
Oh, right.
(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He left me there. You see the mind games?
Yeah.
He asked me to. We were getting along.
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
Alright, well what if we say...
I came to pick you up.
I know. I was just...
Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
Right.
What? I said right.
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
Okay.
You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
Now we have to buy a new couch?!
The one with the Poppie stain?!
It's hardly been used.
Poppie!
What're you doing here?
Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?
Hmm.
No, Poppie! No!!
"Jimmy"
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
"Why. You took a shower?"
"Aw right."
"No...Got dental appointment."
"Yeah!"
"Oh! How d'you like that?"
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
"All right."
"The Velvet fog?"
"What the hell his a velvet fog."
"Well , where is it?."
"AMCA?"
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
"I don't think so."
(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
"No... I find them repugnant and unappealing."
(pointing Kramer) "To wit"
"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
"Really!"
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
" Yeah! What's that."
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
"Kom Pau(sp?"
"Ahh! You too with these?"
"So what did Tim say?"
"Looks like he gave you some Novocaine"
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
"Adults only?"
"What the hell's going on over there?"
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
"Why are you taking this so personally?"
"What about the Velvet Fog ?"
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
"Well...........you know....."
"Not necessarily because....."
"Oh! where's Jennifer today?"
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
"I think so."
"You know! Like a tennis shirt."
"Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't"
"I think I was tucked.!"
"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
"Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?"
"I don't think I'm hungry"
" But I'm damaged goods now."
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
"Jimmy?
"That's the guy?"
"Can't believe your going out with him..."
"I dunno. He's so strange.'
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
"That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks."
"Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.."
"Why?"
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
"What's that?"
"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
"You're turning in to Jimmy."
"Where's my Mr. Goodbar?"
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
No.
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
(answering phone) Hello?
You gotta be there at 430.
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
30 years.
All right, I'll see you later.
Yeah, it is.
No economic reason for them to be here.
No social reason for them to be here.
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
You know Dad just called me.
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
I don't know how you do it.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
Well...
Hey, it happens.
He has no idea who you are.
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
Well, keep looking.
Yeah!
Me either.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
Where are you going?
There's more food down the hall.
Oh, hi.
Actually, I'm drunk.
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
No good?
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
(offering a plate) Chicken?
Poppy seeds!
Hello Newman.
Not from the footage I've seen.
What's going on?
Are you kidding?
Where are they moving to?
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
We could visit together!
That's incredible!
Why?
To spite my parents?
Your parents are crazy!
My parents are moving back too!
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
Hello.
Oh, hi dad.
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
But it's a big complex.
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
Can you blame her?
What do you recommend?
Well, it's been a great visit.
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
You have no idea.
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
(Modest) Oh, thanks.
(Blunt) I believe you.
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Oh?
Uh-huh.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
Oh, okay..
Ohh.. look at this..
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
I'm out.
(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Like what?
(Confused) Where's the punchline?
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
Uh.. one of the three tenors.
Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
Why?
Why not?
Hey, you look awful.
Problem in the bedroom?
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
I thought you didn't want the doormat.
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
Why don't you just get rid of it?
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?
Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
Come in.
Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
(Peeved) I don't have any material!
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.
(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
Well, I want to sit down.
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
My pants!
What?
Dead man walking.
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
She did?
So? Wheels?
Beautiful.
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Catnap?
(deadpan) That must be some book.
Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
I didn't know you had a hopper.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
(downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.
(jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
(passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
Oh, come on.
Alright.
(looking at Kramer) This is nice.
Morning?
(looks at watch) Ten-thirty.
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
Breakfast?
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
What d'you call it?
(deadpan) I think you need more sleep.
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
(indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?
(startled) Kramer!
(confused) Wha..? What time is it?
(aghast) Four in the morning?!
Well, what's wrong with you?
No. Would you just get out?
No!
Ready for lunch?
You think he's faking?
That was him?
Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
(standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
Hey, Bob.
Bob.
Hey, Bobby, over here.
Bob. Oh, Bob.
(louder) Bob!
(urgent whisper) Elaine.
I was just in the bathroom.
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
Well, he flinched, sort of.
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
Actually, no.
Right.
Come in.
That was something.
(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
I'm nuts about her.
She could be an 'it'.
She's got 'it' written all over her.
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
Whatever.
That doesn't sound right.
Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
Walk me down to the Friars.
It's not here.
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
Yeah.
Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
The cleaners? How did it get there?
(irritated) Great.
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
(to Kramer) Hey.
(louder) Hey!!
Sorry, sorry I'm late.
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
(smiling) I don't think so.
My jacket?
(giving in) Alright.
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
(cynical) I'm sure it won't.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
Yeah, we'll do it another time.
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.
(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
Yeah, I'm soured.
I'm sorry. I'm soured.
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.
I'll try and de-sour.
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
I still don't know what that means.
(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!
Who?
What'd she do?
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
Hey, there's uncle Milty.
(pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
The manager.
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
I forgot to take it off.
I'm sorry.
Well, one of the gypsies took it.
Alright.
God, you're right.
Well, I'm a prospective member.
But that guy has my jacket.
Come on.
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Ouf.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
C'mon I need it.
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
Can you believe it?!
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
Ohh, you got the jacket back.
(taking the jacket) Thank you.
Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeahh.
Maybe she'll sweeten.
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
Really I'll be back.
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
(to George) Problems with the house guest?
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
Yeah.... well Elaine.
(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
You what??
(giving up) Check.
You weren't supposed to say that.
That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
No I gave it back to you
Oh Come on!!
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
Forget it.
He wont take ya..
Hey! Greg
Ah! right...nice. Lunch with Elaine?
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Because you know we used to go out.
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
Hi Elaine.
How do you know she's not my wife?
Well, what about the ponytail?
C'mon Ponytail ...Get real.
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
Have you slept with him yet?
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
(continues)Like a shrimp farmer....
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
Turn in?
It's only nine o clock.
I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
Well that's all I got.
Huh?
Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
Why?
Do I really have to explain why?
Yeah Why?
So ,Who is he?
Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
........For spite...
That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
What do you mean?
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
But I changed my mind..
OH! Hey!!
Hey You're staying with my friend George.
Well he doesn't even want himself there.
All right. (sits down)
They make wigs out of human hairs?
Bye!
...Guess so.
Hello..
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
Well it's very emasculating..
Morning.
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
Ooh-ooh
So? She used the toothbrush!
Yeah.
How many years of med school did you have?
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
I'll take fastidious.
What is that?
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
Why didn't you pull over?
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.
Aw, looks just like you.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
That old scam.
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
No.
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
So?
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
You didn't look down?
Poor son of a bitch.
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
I don't know anything about that.
That's the idea.
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
Being really clean and happy?
Disorder?
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
Nah, we've seen it.
What's with the signs?
Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
Hey. So, keys?
I guess they leave that up to the general population.
Hard to say.
Yeah?
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
Hi.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
I'm sorry.
Obviously never.
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
I wouldn't know where to start.
(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!
What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
Oh, man!
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
Yes, that is a definite possibility.
Are you just screwing with me?
Hey, how's life on the road?
I don't doubt it.
What's this?
Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
What the hell are you talking about?
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
Is the flounder here yet?
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
Hey.
Kramer's guys?
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
I don't feel like eating.
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
Well, whatever. So, how've you been?
Good. (pause) Steak knife?
Nah.
Hi.
For what?
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
Sure. Bye.
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
That's true.
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
I don't know what that could be.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
Holy cow! Have a nice life.
He's wailing on that banjo.
I just don't understand the raisinettes.
Yeah.
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
Musicians. Get a real job.
(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
Hey.
Almost.
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
(grudging) Alright.
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
Maybe he has money.
(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Stairmaster?
Nothin'.
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
I could, but I choose not to.
(protesting) I..I didn't say that.
(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.
(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...
(consenting) Alright.
There. Alright?
(defensive) He egged me on.
He's eighty!
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
Cigars!
(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
They're Cuban cigar rollers.
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
What colour is it?
This is quite a condo.
The crepe place?
(doubtful) There's crepe money?
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
What?
Mr Mandelbaum, please.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
I will, I just walked in the door.
Ma.
What?
So?
What's the difference?
(confused) We're talking about people, right?
I thought they smelled pretty nice.
Is not.
Is not.
I'm not having this conversation.
Am not.
Am not.
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
(humouring him) That's very nice.
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
(surprise) This is your son?
(jocular) You got any kids?
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
(under his breath) Oh no.
(laconic) We're already in a hospital.
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
What if it's Neil Diamond?
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
I think he's the same age as the father.
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
You're cold?
Something wrong with your chest?
(leaning round Kramer) Where?
Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
He couldn't handle the weight.
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
(incredulous) Oh, come on!
He was trying to lift the TV.
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
Here.
He was gonna fire you?
Tunisia?
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
Why are the crepes spraying?
That's good stuff.
Can you grab a nap at work.
So what are you doing now?
With a gentleman caller?
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
Shower?
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
Yeah.
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
Drop one. . . . left!
A little less beady today.
Sounds like a really cool fort.
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
He's kind of tied up here.
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
I don't know.
What happened?
How long did that last?
How was the movie?
Why?
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
Just . . . do it.
Hi.
What is that smell?
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
How could you swim in that water?
Swimming?
(on phone) hello.
Who is this?
Why don't you just have him paged?
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
I should have some reason.
Yeah.
Over here. You can see right through here.
It's kind of cozy.
Does it smell like the East River?
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
I don't think it's that bad.
No the stools go over there.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
Hey look at you.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
Could you at least get a hat for me?
Seven and five eighths
Why are you shouting?
Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
think I've changed my mind.
What?
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
Yeah, that's right.
One second. Hello.
Just lie down.
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
I saw it.
Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.
What's up?
Excuse me?
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
Booze is not a religion.
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
What're you doing here?
Well this is very awkward.
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
George...
Hey.
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
I know, but...
5000.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
All right, take it easy.
How you doing?
Whatley. (Like "Newman")
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Poor Beth.
Oh screw him! (George enters)
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
George is already in there.
I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
Excuse me, Mother?
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
Newer magazines.
(In pain) Oh, are you about done?
Huh?
What about all your Jewish jokes?
The Jews?
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
Date with Karen?
What happened to Karen?
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
What?
Kramer, he's just a dentist.
I am not an anti-dentite!
They do have their own schools!
Well, what's wrong?
Talk to me.
Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
Beth and Arnie broke up.
(Shaking his head no) Pff.
Hey, where's Marcy?
Hey, Kramer, over here.
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
Very handsome.
Hi, Mr. Abbott.
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
What?
That's a good one. Dentists.
She went out to get her head shaved.
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
And then?
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
That's the way they do it in Vegas.
I hear things.
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
What's with the fake sneezing?
Do medical schools actually do this?
I think the phone is ringing.
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
Hello?
Elaine?
George??
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
Did he overdose?
What did you do the rest of the day?
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
I thought so.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
One message. Hope it's not from you.
Sophie.
Yep.
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
Right, right, the tractor story.
I sound funny?
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
No, she looks completely normal.
You think she's got toes for thumbs?
I don't know.
Why do I seek your counsel?
That seems about right.
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
Tractor!
Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
She doesn't have toe thumbs.
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
Never.
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
(Sarcastic) You better hurry.
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.
Uncle Leo.
Did I just see that?!
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
Sleeping in the caragain?
(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
(Confused) What's your position?
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.
Yes, it can.
So, who's gonna pull this thing?
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
Who, criminals?
You could get arrested.
(Pleading) Leo..
(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?
(Confused) What does that mean?
(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!
Mom, you too?
Alright, I'll talk to you later.
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
To the Idiotmobile!
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
(Butting in) Tina Turner?
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
(Stern on George) Not underpants.
(Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
I don't read in the bathroom.
Hello?
Uncle Leo?
Nightmares. You?
You're not feeding him, are you?
(Scared) Ah! Kramer!
Get out of here!
Will everybody please leave?!
I want everyone out!
(Bitter) Good night, Newman.
(To Elaine) So, the worst is over?
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
George? What are you doin' here?
(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
So it could be anyone?
That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
Why aren't you there now?
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Where did you get this?
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
So they just gave you this?
How come I haven't read about this?
Son of dad?
We used to come in every day.
All right, make it the large sodas.
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
I remember that night.
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Not as long.
Get going.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
Actually, that's--
Right.
Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
Another friend?
Come on.
Hello?
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
What is that?
So join in.
All right.
Hey, wh-what--
Well Lisi, that was another-
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
Riverside Park.
Back to my place. That's right.
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
How'd it taste?
Yeah.
Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
Well, I'm calling this off right now.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
Hi, Lisi.
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
Have we even been in public?
You are not dumb. Don't say that..
These beans are pretty good.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
Nice to meet ya!
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
Lopper.
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
No. I'm waiting for...
Oh. Sounds great.
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
A long, long weekend.
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
By yourself?
Game over.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
You mean like...Liza!
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
There's a g-spot.
T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Oh, I had that comin' to me.
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
I hired her from a service!
Thank you. Nice job.
Yeah.
What?
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
You have a girlfriend?
At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
It's like 10 minutes by subway.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
Here we go.
And a dead bolt.
Well Cindy, the place looks great.
Ok, I'll see ya.
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
I was going to say, "Being a good host."
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
Yes, I do.
Yes, we have.
The store.
Stuff.
And gum.
She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
Kramer, you're still on the phone?
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
Madeline stays here.
Hey, T-bone!
No T-bone?
No! There's no T-bone!
Why no T-bone?
Yes.
No.
Yeah. It's in your closet.
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
Where you goin'?
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
What did I just pay for?
Koko?
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
40.
I don't know what this is.
Ooh.
I look about the same.
I was talking to him.
Never mind.
What?
Go back.
I said, never mind.
I hate the counter.
Hey.
Oh, she didn't mind?
Hey, that's great.
Elaine got a new number because she died.
Some new kind of pie.
Hey, there's a booth.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
Double zero?
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Good-bye, Koko.
Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
I didn't hear anything.
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
For what?
But you didn't really do any work.
But you took a nap in it.
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
Well, who took the nap?
$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
So is this a breakup/quitting?
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
Miss.
I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
Elaine...
Hello?
I accept.
Well, what happened?
What's around you?
Is it Famous Ray's?
Famous Original Ray's?
Well, what street are you on?
Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
Yeah.
Cindy.
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
What?
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.
Here. I got your money.
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
Well, this is all very sophisticated.
